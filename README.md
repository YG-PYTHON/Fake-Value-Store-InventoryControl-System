# Fake-Value-Store-InventoryControl-System(FVS ICS)
FVS ICS is an inventory control system designed to efficiently model day to day operations of FVS Pharmacy stores.
Before the ICS, all FVS Pharmacys had inefficient database structures that do not properly model the operations of the store.
It is the purpose of this database system to provide an efficient, fast, and practical model for individual FVS Pharamcys.
